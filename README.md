## Getting the most out of JavaScript (without using JavaScript)
There are several reasons for wanting to dip into native code in a JavaScript application. Maybe you want to maximize performance for a critical section of your app by utilizing an existing C++ library. Or, maybe you want to run your code in a browser but don’t want to (or can’t) port to JavaScript. The NodeJS and JavaScript communities offer several ways of interfacing with native code and each approach is best suited to certain use cases. We will take a look at some of these approaches, including WebAssembly and native C/C++ NodeJS addons, while discovering the pros and cons of each.
